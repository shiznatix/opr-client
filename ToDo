Create install script
	deps:
		- bower (npm install -g bower)
		- omxplayer (sudo apt-get install omxplayer)
		- node 6 or greater
		- sshfs (maybe, if client and server is not local)
	install:
		- npm install
		- cd public && bower install && cd ..
		- add to init.d the start/stop script
		- where should it install to?

Init script should be fixed
	- Stop seems to kill all node scripts, not just the one we are killing
	- Check if it allows start to be run even if another process exists

Should we have in config the folder mappings from server to client for random plays? This should be configurable somewhat.
	- Remove mount bash file
	- On start, ensure these folders exist and maybe even try to mount if server is not local

Styles:
	- Browse page is different from all other pages. Make browse page normal
	- When random-settings ajax fails, an error message is displayed. Get vertical centering to work with this

Set file permissions to new files that were made from Mac. Seem to have +x or other chmod stuff

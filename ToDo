Create install script
	deps:
		- omxplayer (sudo apt-get install omxplayer)
		- node 6 or greater
		- sshfs (maybe, if client and server is not local)

Git hooks:
	- On commit this should be run and auto-added if changed:
		vulcanize -p ./ elements/elements.html -o elements/elements.vulcanized.html

Init script should be fixed
	- Log file will grow too large

Should we have in config the folder mappings from server to client for random plays? This should be configurable somewhat.
	- Remove mount bash file
	- On start, ensure these folders exist and maybe even try to mount if server is not local

Styles:
	- Browse page is different from all other pages. Make browse page normal
	- When random-settings ajax fails, an error message is displayed. Get vertical centering to work with this

Browse page:
	- allow sorting the list by title or update time asc / desc
	- add side bar alphabet for fast scrolling in movies folder
	- long file names break the view. maybe this happens on other views too like random settings?
	- going from a small list to a big one doesnt seem to trigger view change

Remote page:
	- remove swipe action, just switch pages when the circles on the bottom are pressed

Random:
	- Fix random to only select 1 show and weight on last played time
